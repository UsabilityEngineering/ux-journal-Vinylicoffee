# Trying "New" Features

Nick Robertson, 11/18/24

In the days leading up to me attending college, my parents and I went out and bought a rice cooker. This specific model is a Zojirushi Micom Rice Cooker & Warmer NS-TSC10. The funny thing about this, is that in the nearly five years of using it, I have only used it to make white rice and have not used any of the other buttons on it to see what they do.

The picture below displays the front facing portion of the rice cooker. Note the 7 buttons on the front and the screen that displays the time in a 24 hour clock.

Right off the bat I already have a few questions, the first relates to the clock. Here in the United States, we use a 12-hour clock, but this is clearly using a 24-hour clock. I had to look this up, but considering that the manufacturer is Japanese, I suppose that it would make sense to use this time convention. Although I am not opposed to using this system, it still takes me time to calculate what it actually is by our time conventions. The only reason that I do partially understand it, is because I play some games that use the 24-hour clock, and even then I still guestimate on approximate times, instead relagating it to things like, "oh, 20:00 is close to night" and "13:25 is like noon". That is to say, to the average person in the United States who is more familiar with the 12-hour clock, using this 24-hour system on the rice cooker is not **effective**.

Moving on from this, the left side "Cancel" button works as expected and differentiates itself from the others by having red text. With nothing happening with the rice cooker, pressing the button does not let out any noise, but I can feel it depress. If the rice cooker were in the process of making something, pressing the button lets out a loud chirp and cancels what it is doing. This provides quality **feedback** that something has happened, and the user can piece together that their action resulted in something, instead of making them second guess themselves.

The orange "Start/Reheat" button operates similarly. If I were to press it, it lets out a little tune to let me know that it is starting the process of making rice. It also has a red light the flicks on to also indicate that it is working. By the time that it has finished its process, it lets out another tune that is different from the first. Although probably not needed, it is **satisfying** and differentiates itself from other cookers, which may just use a one note tone to show that they are starting, or done.

For the longest time, those have been the two buttons I have used considering that I have never cooked anything other than white rice.
