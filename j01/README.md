# Trying "New" Features

Nick Robertson, 11/18/24

In the days leading up to me attending college, my parents and I went out and bought a rice cooker. This specific model is a Zojirushi Micom Rice Cooker & Warmer NS-TSC10. The funny thing about this, is that in the nearly five years of using it, I have only used it to make white rice and have not used any of the other buttons on it to see what they do.

The picture below displays the front facing portion of the rice cooker. Note the 7 buttons on the front and the screen that displays the time in a 24 hour clock.

Right off the bat I already have a few questions, the first relates to the clock. Here in the United States, we use a 12-hour clock, but this is clearly using a 24-hour clock. I had to look this up, but considering that the manufacturer is Japanese, I suppose that it would make sense to use this time convention. Although I am not opposed to using this system, it still takes me time to calculate what it actually is by our time conventions. The only reason that I do partially understand it, is because I play some games that use the 24-hour clock, and even then I still guestimate on approximate times, instead relagating it to things like, "oh, 20:00 is close to night" and "13:25 is like noon". That is to say, to the average person in the United States who is more familiar with the 12-hour clock, using this 24-hour system on the rice cooker is not **effective**.

Moving on from this, the left side "Cancel" button works as expected and differentiates itself from the others by having red text. With nothing happening with the rice cooker, pressing the button does not let out any noise, but I can feel it depress. If the rice cooker were in the process of making something, pressing the button lets out a loud chirp and cancels what it is doing. This provides quality **feedback** that something has happened, and the user can piece together that their action resulted in something, instead of making them second guess themselves.

The orange "Start/Reheat" button operates similarly. If I were to press it, it lets out a little tune to let me know that it is starting the process of making rice. It also has a red light the flicks on to also indicate that it is working. By the time that it has finished its process, it lets out another tune that is different from the first. Although probably not needed, it is **satisfying** and differentiates itself from other cookers, which may just use a one note tone to show that they are starting, or done.

For the longest time, those have been the two buttons I have used considering that I have never cooked anything other than white rice, but I want to expand my horizons and see what else it can do. The "Keep Warm" button is a bit of an oddity to me, if only for the fact that the rice cooker immediately goes into this mode after having finished cooking something. Pressing the button changes the display to show how many hours the rice cooker has been on, and thinking about it now, having this button serves as a nice way to heat something up at the start of the day and return to a meal or left-overs without having to do anything. Like the other buttons, it too lets out a noise to indicate that something has happened and turns on a little orange light below the display.

The "Menu" button is a bit confusing to me, because my **mental model** would like to think that it would pull up a little menu for choosing settings, hence its name, but it instead only changes what food I intend to cook via a little arrow pointing at each option.

Pressing the button moves that arrow down once and after reaching "porridge" it swaps to the opposite side to "sweet". Reaching "cake" and "steam" allows the me change how long I want the rice cooker to run with the "up" and "down" arrows used for "Time Setting". If I press it one more time on "steam" it returns to the "white sushi" option. In this case, I believe that something instead of "Menu" for the button might be more appropriate considering that this **conceptual model** does not match my **mental model**. Something more appropriate could be like, "Food Choice" or "Food Option", but that is just me.

Pressing the "up" and "down" arrows for "Time Setting" changes the clock on the display by 1 minute. The interesting bit about this is that none of the buttons serve as an "enter" button after I get to the correct time, with the cooker instead flashing the time for a few seconds before locking in place. While not inconvenient, it is slightly confusing to me considering that so many things require you to press an "enter" button to make what you did stick.

Lastly, the "Timer" button looks like it will require me to bring out the manual, because I can not seem to get it to work as intended. Pressing it makes the display flash and I can change the time in *10 minute increments*, unlike the previously established 1 minute increments by just pressing the "Time Setting" buttons. 

It also displays a 2 new symbols, a clock and a 1, that I have no clue as to what they do, which is not very **intuitive**. Pressing the "Timer" button again brings up a 2 in place of the 1, and a third time brings it back to the 1 and clock, now requiring that I press the "Cancel" button to go back to the normal display.

Not only is this **inefficient**, but also goes against what was used for the "Menu" button. A better solution to this is making it work like the "Menu" button, only require it to be pressed multiple times to go back to a normal display, instead of using another button. Other than that, I would have to go and look at the manual to figure out what the symbols for the timer actually mean.
