# Trying "New" Features

Nick Robertson, 11/18/24

In the days leading up to me attending college, my parents and I went out and bought a rice cooker. This specific model is a Zojirushi Micom Rice Cooker & Warmer NS-TSC10. The funny thing about this, is that in the nearly five years of using it, I have only used it to make white rice and have not used any of the other buttons on it to see what they do.

The picture below displays the front facing portion of the rice cooker. Note the 7 buttons on the front and the screen that displays the time.
